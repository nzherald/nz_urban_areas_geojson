nz_urban_areas_geojson
============================

Census Urban Area boundaries as used by Statistics New Zealand, converted to GeoJSON

### Special note about this dataset

Urban areas also include a layer with the ID of 502, which is the shape
of all non-urban rural areas. This geojson file exceeds the 100mb Github
file limit, and for this reason has been excluded.
